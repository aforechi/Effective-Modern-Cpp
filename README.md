# Notebooks for Effective Modern C++ book by Scott Meyer


This repository contains code samples found in Effective Modern C++ book by Scott Meyer. It is not officially linked to the book nor to Scott. 

The goal here is to provide C++ learners with a practical approach to play with the concepts explained in the book, but in an iteractive and online manner.  

You can follow code samples online [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/aforechi/Effective-Modern-Cpp/master?filepath=Index.ipynb).
